You are looking at the portfolio site of Maarten ten Velden: a passionate, highly-skilled programmer experience in C++, real-time applications (games) and software design. I would best describe myself as an optimist, a pragmatic, and a systematic thinker.

### What I can do
I am currently pursuing a Bachelor degree in game programming at the [NHTV University of Applied Sciences](https://www.nhtv.nl/ENG/bachelors/creative-media-and-game-technologies/startpage.html) in Breda. I am highly proficient with __C++__ with over 3 years experience using the language. I have also worked with __C#__ and __Java__ in the past.

### Some information about me
I am always looking to challenge myself in news ways. One of my big beliefs is
that learning works through repetitive failure, and sooner rather than later.
In everything I do I value excellence above quantity, whether this is in my
professional work or my personal life. My personal life consists mainly of
self-improvement through a healthy lifestyle and meditation. Ever since I was
seven years old I have been playing the piano. More recently, I have started
playing the guitar and developing my singing voice.
