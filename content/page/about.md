You are looking at the portfolio site of Maarten ten Velden: a programmer with
a passion for object-oriented systems analysis and design. I would best describe
myself as an optimist, a pragmatic, and a systematic thinker.

### Passions and drives
I am always looking to challenge myself in news ways. One of my big beliefs is
that learning works through repetitive failure, and sooner rather than later.
In everything I do I value excellence above quantity, whether this is in my
professional work or my personal life. My personal life consists mainly of
self-improvement through a healthy lifestyle and meditation. Ever since I was
seven years old I have been playing the piano. More recently, I have started
playing the guitar and developing my singing voice.

### Experience
Over the years I have worked with several programming languages, idioms,
methodologies, and CASE tools. My first encounter with programming in general
was through my interest in developing customizations for a popular game called
Minecraft. I worked with __Java__ for about one and a half years before
picking up __C++__ and __C#__ as part of my Bachelor education. My love for C++
exceeds that of all other languages as my first substantial projects were
written in it.

#### Methodologies
Different projects required different methodologies...  
- Scrum
- Throwaway Prototyping
- Waterfall

#### CASE tools
- VS
- Perforce
- GitHub
- Trello
- HacknPlan
- Pivotal
- Jira
