Currently, I study programming and design for games at the NHTV in Breda, which I have been doing for the past three years now. Since I began my game-development journey I have made quite a few games. Just for you, I have collected some of my best work (so far) on this page (scroll down to see them). Send me a personal message to ask me literally anything (you can find contact information at the bottom of every page). Want to know more about who I am? Read more about my personal story by pressing the big button below (the one that says "tell me more")."""
