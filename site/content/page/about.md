If you are reading this I assume you are at least somewhat interested in me. Good, and thank you. The next paragraph explain who I am, how I came to be what I am today and what I want from the future.

I am currently 19 years and studying to get a BSc in programming. The story of how I found my passion and mostly myself is still a WIP, as I am actually not quite there yet.

As a kid I had a big passion for games, that is what got me introduced to programming. This passion I pursued for over 4 years, and I became really proficient at it. Though eventually, I realized that it wasn't exactly right for me. Now, I am going through a phase of self-discovery and I excited to see where this will take me.
