<div class="row">
  <p class="6u 12u$(small)">I'm a game developer who has made games in C++, Unity and Unreal Engine, of which 2D games, 3D games and VR games. I specialized in programming. I pride myself in knowing some Haskell (from functors to monads) and I like to draw and do sound programming (using Supercollider), all of which I think help me in programming.</p>
