<div class="row">
  <p class="6u 12u$(small)">I'm a game developer who has made games in C++, Unity and Unreal Engine, of which 2D games, 3D games and VR games. I pride myself in knowing some Haskell (from functors to monads) and I like to draw and do sound programming (using Supercollider), all of which I think help me look at problems differently.</p>

  <p class="6u 12u$(small)">The earliest memory of making games I have is that I played Minecraft and wanted to make mods for it. I thus taught myself Java programming using internet tutorials in highschool, but quickly got carried away into making games and no Minecraft mod (though I did end up making a mod years later).</p>
