# What I learned
This project is my latest and greatest one. I joined the team 4 weeks into development and I received a warm welcome. Utilizing my freedom of choice, I chose to focus on those topics that I was least proficient in. I also learned how to use JIRA, how to do code-reviews and researched the formal SDLC in general. But perhaps most important is that I did a lot of self-discovery and maturing.

* __<span style="color:#00ff99">Software design</span>__  
My biggest motivator for joining this project was its opportunity to improve my rather fragile software design capabilities. Up until this point, I had always struggled to perform 'proper' Object-Oriented programming (using principles such as encapsulation, granularity, dependency, etc.) and lacked knowledge of Design Patterns and Anti-Patterns. As this project was understaffed and multiple systems remained non-designed, this proposed the perfect learning opportunity for me, which I seized wholeheartedly.

* __<span style="color:#00ff99">Pragmatism</span>__  
As I mentioned, a big chunk of the development I did during this project was personal. However, this mindset-change had direct effects on the amount and quality of work I was able to deliver. As I tried to become more honest, open,  reflective, and practical (partly due to [psychological research](blogs) I did) I became better at generating high-quality results quickly.

* __<span style="color:#ff6666">Purpose</span>__  
As I discovered, the majority of the team members saw this project as an opportunity to specialize their skills. Me, I am more of a pragmatically-minded person. Therefore, I wasn't all that happy with the team's intent. My biggest concern is my expectation that the project will remain forever unused as there is no active community supporting it. Meanwhile, some action has been taken and the leads of this team are trying to find a unique selling-point to create some market value.
