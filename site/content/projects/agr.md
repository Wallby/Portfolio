# What I learned
During the 2 months that this project lasted, I learned graphics programming and PS4 development through hands-on practical experience. All of my contributions to this projects were at the same time learning experiences for me, as I had never done anything alike.

* __<span style="color:#00ff99">Scope</span>__  
This project forced us to down-scope drastically. Developing an engine whilst simultaneously developing a product with it forced us to iterate quickly and continuously adjust our production plan.

* __<span style="color:#00ff99">Parity</span>__  
Maintaining parity on multiple platforms posed a significant challenge. It forced us to slow down and consider were to spend our effort carefully.

* __<span style="color:#ff6666">Quality assurance</span>__  
Issues became apparent during the final weeks of the project when it was too late to fix them, when bugs started arising and delivered features were not functioning correctly.

* __<span style="color:#ff6666">Automation</span>__  
 The beneficial value that automation can have were overlooked. As a result, lots of processes in this project were manually maintained, causing a lot of overhead and wasted time.
