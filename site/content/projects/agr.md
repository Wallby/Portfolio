# What I learned
During the 2 months that this project lasted, I learned graphics programming and PS4 development through hands-on practical experience. All of my contributions to this projects were at the same time learning experiences for me, as I had never done anything alike.

Something that was overlooked by the development team this project was the value of project setup. The issues that this caused became apparent during the final weeks of the project, when bugs started arising and delivered features were not functioning correctly.
