# What I learned
After working around the clock as a Scrum Master for the two marmalades before this one, I decided to spend the last one doing regular programming work. This not only allowed me to reduce stress, it also allowed me to learn from observing someone else performing the role I previously fulfilled, forcing me to reflect on my past choices and approaches.

* __<span style="color:#00ff99">Unreal Engine</span>__  
As this was my first chance to work full-time as a programmer using Unreal Engine 4, I am confident in saying that this marmalade has taught me a great deal of what I know now about the engine. Furthermore, it showed me how easy it is for a project that uses a visual scripting language (UE4's Blueprints)  to lose all forms of logical structure.

* __<span style="color:#ff6666">Assertiveness</span>__  
Something I have struggled with in the past is assertiveness. Before this project, I was convinced that a harsh Scrum Master would ruin the team's atmosphere. By observing the replacement Scrum Master, I noticed that this prejudice was completely faulty. As a clear structure (and, of course, a humane approach) seemed to only increase the team-spirit. This inspired me greatly and I have since worked immensely on my honesty and courage.

# What I made

## Homing missile
<div class="row">
<p class="6u 12u$(small)">
As we were such a small team with very limited time I did the programming, design and art work for the homing missile. Using my Paint.NET experience and the power of search engines, I created this simplistic HUD.
</p>
<p class="6u 12u$(small)" style="text-align: center;">
<img style="max-width: 400px;" src="/img/projects/halo_hunters/homing_missile.png" width=100%>
</p>
</div>

## Main menu
<div class="row">
<p class="6u 12u$(small)" style="text-align: center;">
<img style="max-width: 600px;" src="/img/projects/halo_hunters/main_menu.png" width=100%>
</p>
<p class="6u 12u$(small)">
As I created a significant chunk of the game's multiplayer experience (namely split-screen, input and player selection), I took it upon myself to add polish in the form of a main menu to deliver a flowing experience to the end user. I reused some old assets to build an inviting scene, made sure the player feedback was nice and responsive, and (catering to the impatient) added rotatable player models.
