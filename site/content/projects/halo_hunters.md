description: "Halo Hunters is an arena shooter played locally with up to four players made in the third year of my game development bachelor at  [IGAD](https://www.nhtv.nl/ENG/bachelors/creative-media-and-game-technologies/startpage.html). The game was made from concept to final product in a period of two weeks as part of a so-called game marmalade (i.e. an extended game jam). Another marmalade game is [Mayor](../mayor)."

## Homing missile
<div class="row">
<p class="6u 12u$(small)">
As we were such a small team with very limited time I did the programming, design and art work for the homing missile. Using my Paint.NET experience and the power of search engines, I created this simplistic HUD.

</div>

## Main menu
<div class="row">
<p class="6u 12u$(small)" style="text-align: center;">
<img style="max-width: 600px;" src="/img/projects/halo_hunters/main_menu.png" width=100%>
</p>
<p class="6u 12u$(small)">
As I created a significant chunk of the game's multiplayer experience (namely split-screen, input and player selection), I took it upon myself to add polish in the form of a main menu to deliver a flowing experience to the end user. I reused some old assets to build an inviting scene, made sure the player feedback was nice and responsive, and (catering to the impatient) added rotatable player models.
