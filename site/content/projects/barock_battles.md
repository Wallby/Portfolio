# What I learned
This marvelous game was made with a huge team consisting of seven artists, one audio gal, four programmers, and two designers. The big team size ended up being more of a burden than a benefit. At the end of the game jam the amount of produces content was overwhelming, the only problem remaining was to get it all in the game in time.

* __<span style="color:#00ff99">Animations</span>__  
A nice component of game jams for me, is the ability to do things I would otherwise be unlikely to do. In this game jam I learned how to implement animations in Unity.

* __<span style="color:#ff6666">Structure and patterns</span>__  
In my experience with game jams in the past I have learned that working fast at the expense of structure usually comes back to bite you later on. Now I make use of programming design patterns to minimize issues and still be productive.
