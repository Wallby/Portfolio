# What I learned
In the first of the three marmalades, which also lasted two weeks, I had my first experience as Scrum Master ever. Learning everything about Scrum in combination with a short deadline created an environment for rapid trial and error. The second marmalade (which is this one) allowed me to start over using everything I had learned so far.

* __<span style="color:#00ff99">Rapid prototyping</span>__  
To get people working quickly and eliminate dependencies as much as possible I focused heavily on measurable small prototypes (e.g. 5 simple heist scenario designs). This had two key benefits: it occupied every member in the team and created a high burn-down velocity, which kept team members motivated.

* __<span style="color:#00ff99">Facilitating communication</span>__  
The first marmalade stressed the importance of constant communication in a rapidly evolving product like this one. Therefore, I setup a minimal amount of carefully chosen communication channels (Slack channels). The team used each and every one intensively and as a result the evolution of the project is easily navigable.

* __<span style="color:#ff6666">The right amount of effort</span>__  
Something this project taught me is that you should only do what's most important. In this case I tracked too closely the hours and details of what happened in each sprint. I only ended up using a minimal amount of the metrics that I collected, meaning that I essentially wasted quite a bit of effort.

* __<span style="color:#ff6666">Assertiveness</span>__  
Due to my overwhelming insecurities I struggled with at that time, I found it difficult to be assertive. This project revealed to me how big a role authority plays in achieving results and even in gaining respect from your team.
