description: "Mayor is a city management game made in the third year of my game development bachelor at  [IGAD](https://www.nhtv.nl/ENG/bachelors/creative-media-and-game-technologies/startpage.html). The game was made from concept to final product in a period of two and a half weeks as part of a so-called game marmalade (i.e. an extended game jam). Another marmalade game is [Halo Hunters](../halo_hunters)."

## Traffic system
<div class="row">
<p class="6u 12u$(small)">
Because of my irregular schedule as a result of growing into the role of Scrum Master, I allowed myself to work only on aesthetic tasks to not become a bottleneck for others. The city layout I was provided with, was far from grid-like, therefore I settled on a node-based system, which was very flexible. The smooth car movement was achieved using some clever tricks to create "fake" acceleration/deceleration. Kudos to the artist who inspired this amazingly simple solution.
